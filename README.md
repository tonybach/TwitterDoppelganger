# Twitter Doppelganger

If you use Twitter, then out of all the Twitter users that you follow (or "friends" for short), who do you think you are most similar to? Our app will help you find out, by calculating a similarity score between you and each of your Twitter friend. The methodology includes looking at three difference aspects: profile similarity, network similarity and content similarity.

The algorithm code is done, but we are working on the web app version so you can actually try it out. In the meantime, check out our [poster](https://github.com/tonybach/TwitterDoppelganger/blob/master/poster.pdf)!
